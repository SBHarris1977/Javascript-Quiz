# Javascript-Quiz
In the JavaScript Quiz I was tasked with creating a timed test, that will also include a score for each correct answer. The test is also timed and once the user completes the test they are asked to enter their intitials. Both the score and the tester's intitials are saved in local storage.
 
In my HTML I added a question div along with all possbile options with a radial button. I found this method to be a bit easier because I'm more comfortable with HTML versus JavaScript. I have a quiz.js file and a question.js because having the questions mixed in with the code was just too much on one page.

I had trouble getting the timer added as well as computing the score and saving to local storage. But with the help of my TA I was able to get the score working. I was successful adding the local storage requirement by reviewing class notes. However, no success with the timer, but I will revisit once I am more familiar with JavaScript.
